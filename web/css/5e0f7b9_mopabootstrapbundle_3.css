 * Import this file in your sass files as first to be abled to access sass vars from your file

 * Add it to the stylesheets of assetic or
 *
 * Be careful when using less this way, might be most straight forward, but assetic doesnt check the included files
 * for changes, and will only regenerate the css if it detects changes in this file!
 *
 * For development it might be easier to include all you sass files in the layout directly
 * But then assetic will compile each sass file in a own compiler session so you cant mix in the sass style into bootstrap, which might not be OK
